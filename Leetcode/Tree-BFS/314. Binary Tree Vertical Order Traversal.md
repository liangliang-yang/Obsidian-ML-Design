Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _**the vertical order traversal** of its nodes' values_. (i.e., from top to bottom, column by column).

If two nodes are in the same row and column, the order should be from **left to right**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
**Output:** [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [3,9,8,4,0,1,7]
**Output:** [[4],[9],[3,0,1],[8],[7]]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,10,9,11,null,5,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,6]
**Output:** [[4],[2,5],[1,10,9,6],[3],[11]]

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution:
    def verticalOrder(self, root):
        if not root: # special case
            return []
        
        columnDict = defaultdict(list) # store {column: [nodes]}
        q = deque()
        q.append((root, 0)) # 记 root column=0, 左边为负数， 右边为正数

        while q:
            node, column = q.popleft()
            columnDict[column].append(node.val)

            if node.left:
                q.append((node.left, column - 1))
            if node.right:
                q.append((node.right, column + 1))
                        
        res = []
        for col, nodes in sorted(columnDict.items()):
            res.append(nodes)
        return res
```

#### **Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity: O(NlogN) where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
    
    In the first part of the algorithm, we do the BFS traversal, whose time complexity is O(N) since we traversed each node once and only once.
    
    In the second part, in order to return the ordered results, we then sort the obtained hash table by its keys, which could result in the O(NlogN) time complexity in the worst case scenario where the binary tree is extremely imbalanced (for instance, each node has only left child node.)
    
    As a result, the overall time complexity of the algorithm would be O(NlogN).
    
- Space Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
    
    First of all, we use a hash table to group the nodes with the same column index. The hash table consists of keys and values. In any case, the values would consume O(N) memory. While the space for the keys could vary, in the worst case, each node has a unique column index, _i.e._ there would be as many keys as the values. Hence, the total space complexity for the hash table would still be O(N).
    
    During the BFS traversal, we use a `queue` data structure to keep track of the next nodes to visit. At any given moment, the queue would hold no more two levels of nodes. For a binary tree, the maximum number of nodes at a level would be 2N+1​ which is also the number of leafs in a full binary tree. As a result, in the worst case, our queue would consume at most O(2N+1​⋅2)=O(N) space.
    
    Lastly, we also need some space to hold the results, which is basically a reordered hash table of size O(N) as we discussed before.
    
    To sum up, the overall space complexity of our algorithm would be O(N).


### Solution 2: BFS no sorting - O (N)

#### **Intuition**

In the previous approach, it is a pity that the sorting of results overshadows the main part of the algorithm which is the BFS traversal. One might wonder if we have a way to eliminate the need for sorting. And the answer is yes.

> The key insight is that we only need to know the **range** of the column index (_i.e._ `[min_column, max_column]`). Then we can simply _**iterate**_ through this range to generate the outputs without the need for sorting.

The above insight would work under the _condition_ that there won't be any missing column index in the given range. And the condition always holds, since there won't be any broken branch in a binary tree.

#### **Algorithm**

To implement this optimization, it suffices to make some small modifications to our previous BFS approach.

During the BFS traversal, we could obtain the range of the column indices, _i.e._ with the variable of `min_column` and `max_column`.

At the end of the BFS traversal, we would then walk through the column range `[min_column, max_column]` and retrieve the results accordingly.


```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution:
    def verticalOrder(self, root):
        if not root: # special case
            return []
        
        columnDict = defaultdict(list) # store {column: [nodes]}
        q = deque()
        q.append((root, 0)) # 记 root column=0, 左边为负数， 右边为正数

        min_column_num = 0 # init the min column number, use root column number
        max_column_num = 0 # init the max column number, use root column number

        while q:
            node, column = q.popleft()
            columnDict[column].append(node.val)

            # update the min/max column number
            min_column_num = min(min_column_num, column)
            max_column_num = max(max_column_num, column)

            if node.left:
                q.append((node.left, column - 1))
            if node.right:
                q.append((node.right, column + 1))
                        
        res = []
        # we know the column number is from min_column_num -> max_column_num
        for col in range(min_column_num, max_column_num+1):
            res.append(columnDict[col])
        return res
    
# Time Complexity: O(N)
# Space Complexity: O(N)
```

### **Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree.  
      
      
    Following the same analysis in the previous BFS approach, the only difference is that this time we don't need the costy sorting operation (_i.e._ O(NlogN)).
    
- Space Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. The analysis follows the same logic as in the previous BFS approach.
