#LeetCode-Sliding-Window 

https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/description/

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the maximum number of consecutive_ `1`_'s in the array if you can flip at most_ `k` `0`'s.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** [1,1,1,0,0,**1**,1,1,1,1,**1**]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** [0,0,1,1,**1**,**1**,1,1,1,**1**,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums, k):
        
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        left = 0
        maxLen = float('-inf')
        zero_cnt = 0 # count 0 inside window

        for right in range(len(nums)):
            # window is [left ..... right], include right

            if nums[right] == 0:
                zero_cnt += 1

            # 我们需要确保 window 里面不超过 K 个 0
            while zero_cnt > k and left <= right:
                # 如果超过了，就要移动 left， 但是 left 不能超过 right
                if nums[left] == 0:
                    zero_cnt -= 1
                left += 1

            curLen = right-left+1
            maxLen = max(maxLen, curLen)

        return maxLen
        
```


**Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array. In worst case we might end up visiting every element of array twice, once by left pointer and once by right pointer.
    
- Space Complexity: O(1). We do not use any extra space.
