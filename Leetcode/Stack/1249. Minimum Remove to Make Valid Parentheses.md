#LeetCode-Stack

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses/description/


Given a string s of `'('` , `')'` and lowercase English characters.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( `'('` or `')'`, in any positions ) so that the resulting _parentheses string_ is valid and return **any** valid string.

Formally, a _parentheses string_ is valid if and only if:

- It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
- It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are valid strings, or
- It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a valid string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"
**Output:** "lee(t(c)o)de"
**Explanation:** "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "a)b(c)d"
**Output:** "ab(c)d"

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "))(("
**Output:** ""
**Explanation:** An empty string is also valid.

### **Intuition**

We've caused the balance to go negative while checking again. Even though we have the same number of `"("` and `")"` in the string, they don't match up. The last `")"` is _before_ the last `"("`. We don't want to do another round of removing `")"`, because that would no longer be optimal. We need to identify which `"("` each of our `")"` is actually pairing with. Here is the example with a different color to show each pair. A `")"` always pairs with the _closest_ `"("` that doesn't already have a pair.

The 2 `"("` that don't pair with a `")"` are the ones we should remove. This way, we know we won't cause a negative balance.

So, remembering that each `")"` was paired with the _closest_ `"("` that isn't already paired, how could we do this in code? We need to know the indexes of the problematic `"("`.

We can use a **stack**. Each time we see a `"("`, we should add its index to the stack. Each time we see a `")"`, we should remove an index from the stack because the `")"` will match with whatever `"("` was at the top of the stack. The _length of the stack_ is equivalent to the `balance` from above. We will need to do the:

1. Remove a `")"` if it is encountered when stack was already empty (prevent negative balance).
2. Remove a `"("` if it is left on stack at end (prevent non-zero final balance).


### **Algorithm**

Let's put all this together into a 2-pass algorithm.

1. Identify all indexes that should be removed.
2. Build a new string with removed indexes.

As explained above, we should use a **stack**. If we put the _indexes_ of the `"("` on the stack, then we'll know that all the indexes on the stack at the _end_ are the indexes of the unmatched `"("`. We should also use a **set** to keep track of the unmatched `")"` we come across. Then, we can remove the character at each of those indexes and then return the edited string.

We need to be really careful with that "removal" step though, as it can be done in O(n), but there are many ways of accidentally making it O(n2). Making these mistakes (and not fixing them) in an interview won't look good. Here's some operations that are O(n) that people sometimes assume are O(1).

- Adding or removing (or even changing) just one character _anywhere_ in a **string** is O(n), because strings are **immutable**. The entire string is rebuilt for every change.
- Adding or removing _not from the end_ of a list, vector, or array is O(n) because the other items are moved up to make a gap or down to fill in the gap.
- Checking if an item is in a list, because this requires a **linear search**. Even if you use binary search, it'll still be O(logn), which is not ideal for this problem.

A safe strategy is to iterate over the string and insert each character we want to keep into a **list** (Python) or **StringBuilder** (Java). Then once we have all the characters, it is a single O(n) step to convert them into a string.


### Solution

 1. Convert string to list, because String is an immutable data structure in Python and it's much easier and memory-efficient to deal with a list for this task.

 2. Iterate through list

 3. Keep track of indices with open parentheses in the stack. In other words, when we come across open parenthesis we add an index to the stack.

 4. When we come across close parenthesis we pop an element from the stack. If the stack is empty we replace current list element with an empty string

 5. After iteration, we replace all indices we have in the stack with empty strings, because we don't have close parentheses for them.

 6. Convert list to string and return
