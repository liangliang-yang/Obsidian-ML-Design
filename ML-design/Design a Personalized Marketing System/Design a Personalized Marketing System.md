### **6. Model Development**

#### User Profiling & Segmentation (Clustering)

- Use **K-means or DBSCAN** for clustering users based on demographic and behavioral data.
- For example, we could create clusters such as “Frequent Shoppers,” “Holiday Shoppers,” and “Bargain Hunters.”

#### Recommendation Engine (Collaborative Filtering)

- **Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD)** or **Deep Learning Embeddings** for product recommendations based on past purchases and preferences.
- This will help suggest items like clothing, electronics, or groceries based on user preferences and similar users’ behavior.

#### Campaign Optimization (Multi-Armed Bandit)

- Implement **Thompson Sampling** to select the best-performing campaign for each user while allowing for exploration.
- Campaign options might include:
    - 10% discount for a first-time buyer
    - Free shipping for a high-frequency user
    - Loyalty points for signing up for a new offer

#### Attribution Modeling (Multi-Touch Attribution)

- Use **Logistic Regression with Time Decay** to attribute conversions to different touchpoints (e.g., SMS, email, app notification).
- **Time Decay Factors**: Give more weight to recent interactions, capturing the impact of each touchpoint based on its timing relative to the conversion.

### **7. Model Evaluation**

#### Evaluation Metrics

- **Profiling and Segmentation**: Use **Silhouette Score** and **Cluster Purity** to assess clustering quality.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Use **Precision@K, Recall@K,** and **Mean Average Precision (MAP)** to evaluate relevance.
- **Campaign Optimization**: Track **CTR, Conversion Rate**, and **Cumulative Reward** to see how well the multi-armed bandit is performing.
- **Attribution Modeling**: Evaluate attribution accuracy using **F1 Score** and compare with baseline models (e.g., last-click attribution).

#### A/B Testing

- Run A/B tests for different campaign strategies and compare the performance across user segments to validate if personalized content is driving higher engagement.

### **8. Model Serving**

#### Deployment Strategy

- **Real-Time Serving**: Deploy user profiling and recommendation models in real-time, allowing Target’s app and website to provide live recommendations.
- **Batch Updates for Segmentation**: Update user segments periodically (e.g., daily or weekly) to adapt to recent behavior changes.
- **Campaign Selection via API**: Use a REST API to serve campaign recommendations by running the multi-armed bandit model in real-time.

#### Infrastructure

- **Data Pipelines (e.g., Kafka, Spark Streaming)**: Stream user data to update profiles in near real-time.
- **Model Hosting**: Use cloud infrastructure, such as AWS or GCP, to host models with scaling capabilities to handle increased traffic.
- **Monitoring**: Implement logging and tracking to monitor model performance and alert if certain campaigns are over- or underperforming.

### Summary

Using Target as an example, this system would enable personalized marketing by dynamically profiling users, segmenting them into relevant categories, and optimizing campaigns across multiple channels. Multi-armed bandit algorithms ensure continuous optimization, while real-time recommendations increase customer engagement with tailored product suggestions. Multi-touch attribution ensures Target can accurately credit the success of each marketing touchpoint, informing future campaign strategies. This approach provides a scalable, adaptive, and privacy-conscious solution that delivers a personalized shopping experience across all touchpoints.
