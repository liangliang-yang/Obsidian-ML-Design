This article outlines Target's approach to creating a highly personalized offer recommendation system for guests using an AI-driven contextual multi-arm bandit (CMAB) model. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

## Structure

### 1. **Goal and Solution**

- **Goal**: To boost guest engagement and drive visits to Target by making relevant offers.
- **Solution**: The development of an AI-based recommendation engine called CORE, which uses personalization techniques to suggest offers tailored to each guest’s interests.

### 2. **Contextual Multi-Arm Bandit (CMAB) Algorithm**

- The CMAB approach helps CORE make decisions based on the "state of the environment" (i.e., guest context), which means it can adapt and deliver offers that are more contextually relevant.
- It combines **Matrix Factorization (MF)** with CMAB to better understand and match guest preferences with offers.

### 3. **Matrix Factorization (MF) Using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF)**

- **Interaction Matrix**: Target creates an interaction matrix using historical guest-offer data. Due to sparse interactions (few guests interact with each offer), the matrix needs to be simplified.
- **NNMF**: NNMF decomposes this matrix into two matrices:
    - **W (User Matrix)**: Represents guest features.
    - **H (Offer Matrix)**: Represents offer features.
- This factorization fills in missing data by finding latent factors that reveal underlying patterns in guest preferences and offer attributes. NNMF reduces sparsity, making it easier to approximate guest-offer interactions and allowing CORE to improve recommendations.

### 4. **The Role of CMAB in CORE**

- **Agent-Environment Interaction**: CORE’s agent selects offers (actions) and learns based on feedback (rewards) to refine its estimates over time.
- **Neural Epsilon-Greedy Agent**: A deep neural network, comprising three key networks, balances exploration (trying new offers) and exploitation (choosing the best offer based on existing data):
    - **Guest Network**: Analyzes guest context features.
    - **Offer Network**: Processes offer-specific features.
    - **Common Tower Network**: Combines data from the guest and offer networks to make final predictions on the reward for each action.

### 5. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**

- CORE balances exploration (testing diverse offers to understand guest preferences better) with exploitation (using the data to make highly relevant offer recommendations).
- This balance is similar to managing **bias-variance trade-offs** in machine learning; too much exploration may result in suboptimal recommendations in the short term, while too much exploitation may limit the model to only previously recommended offers.

### 6. **Optimizing Recommendations with Epsilon-Greedy Strategy**

- **Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm**: With a probability of epsilon, the agent explores by selecting a random action, while with a probability of 1-epsilon, it exploits by choosing the best-known option.
- By fine-tuning epsilon, CORE manages to adapt to dynamic guest preferences and stay relevant with changing trends, ensuring a blend of learning and accuracy in the recommendations it provides.


## Contextual Multi-Arm Bandit (CMAB) Algorithm

In this part, the article is describing the three key components of the CORE recommendation system — **Environment**, **Reward Estimation**, and **Agent** — and how they work together to make personalized offer recommendations.

### 1. **Environment**

- The **Environment** provides all the contextual information the system needs about each guest and the offers available.
- This includes details about guests (e.g., preferences, behavior patterns) and metadata on each offer. Importantly, it also includes **latent features** (from matrix **H**), which are deeper, hidden characteristics extracted during matrix factorization that reveal patterns or associations.
- By providing this comprehensive context, the environment enables the CORE algorithm to make informed, context-specific decisions when recommending offers.

### 2. **Reward Estimation**

- **Rewards** are the feedback signals used to measure how effective an offer recommendation was (e.g., if a guest engages with or redeems the offer). This feedback is a critical part of learning, as it helps the model understand which types of offers work best for different guests.
- **Reward Estimation** involves calculating these rewards based on the approximate interaction matrix (**I′**), a refined version of the original interaction matrix. This matrix, created using matrix factorization, retains essential information about guest-offer interactions while filling in gaps from sparse data, making reward calculations more accurate.
- As the model observes these rewards, it continuously learns and adapts, gradually improving its recommendations.

### 3. **Agent**

- The **Agent** is the decision-maker in this system. It uses the context provided by the environment and the rewards it has learned from to decide which offers to recommend to each guest.
- This agent employs a **Neural Epsilon-Greedy** approach, combining exploration (testing new offers) and exploitation (selecting offers with the highest predicted reward). It’s structured as a deep neural network that approximates the expected reward for each offer based on the context.
- By balancing exploration and exploitation, the agent avoids being stuck on previous choices, ensuring it adapts to evolving guest preferences and market trends.

In essence, the **environment supplies context and metadata**, **reward estimation helps the system learn from feedback**, and the **agent makes context-driven, data-informed decisions** on offer recommendations. Together, these components create a dynamic recommendation system that can adapt and improve over time.

## Code
### Step 1: Define the Environment

We'll set up a basic environment that provides guest and offer information, including the latent offer features (`H` matrix) from matrix factorization. For simplicity, we’ll assume we have the guest context and offer matrix ready.


```python
import numpy as np

class Environment:
    def __init__(self, guest_context, offer_features):
        self.guest_context = guest_context  # Guest data/context (e.g., preferences)
        self.offer_features = offer_features  # Latent features of each offer (from H matrix)
        
    def get_context(self, guest_id):
        # Retrieve context (guest info and offer features)
        return self.guest_context[guest_id], self.offer_features

```

### Step 2: Define Reward Estimation

In a real system, the reward would come from actual user interactions. Here, we'll simulate it as a random feedback mechanism that indicates whether the guest liked the offer or not.


```python
class RewardEstimator:
    def __init__(self, interaction_matrix_approx):
        self.interaction_matrix_approx = interaction_matrix_approx  # Approx. guest-offer interactions (I′ matrix)

    def get_reward(self, guest_id, offer_id):
        # Simulate a reward based on approximate interaction values in I′
        # For example, reward = 1 if guest interacts positively, 0 otherwise
        reward_probability = self.interaction_matrix_approx[guest_id, offer_id]
        return np.random.binomial(1, reward_probability)  # 1 with probability = reward_probability

```

### Step 3: Define the Agent (Neural Epsilon-Greedy)

We’ll create an agent that balances exploration and exploitation using the epsilon-greedy approach. Here, we'll use a simple neural network to estimate expected rewards for each offer.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class NeuralEpsilonGreedyAgent:
    def __init__(self, guest_features_dim, offer_features_dim, epsilon=0.1):
        self.epsilon = epsilon
        self.model = self._build_model(guest_features_dim, offer_features_dim)
        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(self.model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
        self.criterion = nn.MSELoss()

    def _build_model(self, guest_dim, offer_dim):
        # A neural network with guest and offer features input, outputting a reward prediction
        return nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(guest_dim + offer_dim, 256),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(256, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 1)
        )

    def predict_reward(self, guest_features, offer_features):
        input_data = torch.cat((guest_features, offer_features), dim=1)
        return self.model(input_data).item()

    def choose_offer(self, guest_features, offer_features):
        if np.random.rand() < self.epsilon:
            # Exploration: Randomly choose an offer
            offer_idx = np.random.randint(0, offer_features.shape[0])
        else:
            # Exploitation: Choose offer with the highest predicted reward
            rewards = [self.predict_reward(guest_features, offer_features[i].unsqueeze(0))
                       for i in range(offer_features.shape[0])]
            offer_idx = np.argmax(rewards)
        return offer_idx

    def update_model(self, guest_features, offer_features, reward):
        # Train the model to minimize loss between predicted and actual reward
        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
        prediction = self.model(torch.cat((guest_features, offer_features), dim=1))
        loss = self.criterion(prediction, torch.tensor([[reward]], dtype=torch.float))
        loss.backward()
        self.optimizer.step()

```

### Step 4: Putting It All Together

Now, we can initialize the environment, reward estimator, and agent, then simulate the process of recommending offers and learning from rewards.

```python
# Dummy data setup
guest_context = torch.rand(10, 5)  # 10 guests, 5 context features
offer_features = torch.rand(20, 5)  # 20 offers, 5 latent features (H matrix)
interaction_matrix_approx = np.random.rand(10, 20)  # Approximate interaction matrix I′

# Initialize components
env = Environment(guest_context, offer_features)
reward_estimator = RewardEstimator(interaction_matrix_approx)
agent = NeuralEpsilonGreedyAgent(guest_features_dim=5, offer_features_dim=5)

# Simulation loop
for episode in range(100):
    guest_id = np.random.randint(0, 10)  # Randomly select a guest
    guest_features, offer_features = env.get_context(guest_id)
    
    # Agent selects an offer
    offer_id = agent.choose_offer(guest_features, offer_features)
    chosen_offer_features = offer_features[offer_id].unsqueeze(0)
    
    # Environment generates reward based on interaction matrix
    reward = reward_estimator.get_reward(guest_id, offer_id)
    
    # Agent updates the model with the observed reward
    agent.update_model(guest_features, chosen_offer_features, reward)
    
    print(f"Episode {episode + 1}: Guest {guest_id} -> Offer {offer_id} | Reward: {reward}")

```


### Explanation

- **Environment**: Supplies guest context and latent offer features.
- **Reward Estimator**: Simulates a feedback mechanism, generating rewards based on the approximate interaction matrix.
- **Agent**: Uses a neural network with an epsilon-greedy strategy to decide between exploration (random offers) and exploitation (best-known offers). It updates itself based on observed rewards, improving recommendations over time.

This example code demonstrates a basic workflow of CORE’s recommendation system, where the agent learns to make better offer recommendations through trial and error, adjusting to guest preferences over time.
